# Leaf Segementation
A project written as part of Introduction to Image Processing and Computer Vision course at Warsaw Univeristy of Technology.

This Python script is designed to segment out the leaves from background. 
It reads the images from `color` directory and compares the resulting images with benchmarks in `segmented` directory.
